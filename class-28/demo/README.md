# Props and State

Applications are comprised of many components, usually working together to perform a higher level task. As such, they'll all need access to state, methods to read/modify state, and an ability to respond to triggered actions in other, related components. Today, we'll explore how React applications do this, using JSX attributes, better known as `props`
